%%------Shockwave Flash Movie-------%%
In order to work on this sample movie 
you have to be sure that Flash.ocx file 
is already registered on your machine.

There are several way to do verify that.
The easiest way constits on opening the 
Registry Editor by typing 'regedit' at 
the DOS prompt. You can search for
 your control object by going to the 
EDIT menu and Find.

It will likely be in the following structure: 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/file_name

Other ones are described in the TS solution:

In attachment I let you a copy of 
the file Flash.ocx, that you may copy on 
your machine, if Flash.ocx wasn't present.
